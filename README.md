# VITyarthi-project
This project is created for my course work. It includes the code, documents and other files needed for the final submission. The goal is to show how I planned, designed and built the solution by using the concepts learned in class. The repository also has screenshots and recordings to help understand how the project works.

Track and analyze student performance with VIT-Yarthi. Python Tkinter-based system includes add/update/delete, search, sort, CSV/PDF export, grade calculation, and interactive charts. Dark/light theme and data auto-repair ensure smooth and user-friendly operation.
